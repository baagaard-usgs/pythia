## Description

This is the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) fork of
Pythia/Pyre originally written by Michael Aivazis (California
Institute of Technology).

Pythia/Pyre provides a Python framework for scientific
simulations. This fork focuses (and maintains) functionality for:

* specification of simulation parameters
* specification of units and unit conversions
* user-friendly interface to popular batch job schedulers
* Python and C++ interfaces for logging

**Note** Starting with Pythia 1.0.0, nemesis is part of Pythia.
